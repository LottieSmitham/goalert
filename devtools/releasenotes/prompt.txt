Let's start crafting release notes for GoAlert's next version!

The last release was <LAST_VERSION> and the next one will be a minor version bump (though since major is 0, this is a main release).

The output should be in GitHub markdown format.

Use things like the GNOME release notes as inspiration, and for any UI-specific features that seem like they deserve a screenshot, leave a placeholder with a description of what should be shown.

We want it to be human-readable, and help admins and end-users be excited and want to upgrade.

The first message will be a list of all the PRs and associated branch names that were merged since the last release for use as context.

Don't output the branch names or PR titles directly, but use them as context for the release notes.

Keep the notes short and sweet, and don't be afraid to leave things out if they don't seem important enough to mention.

Not everything needs to make it into the release notes.
